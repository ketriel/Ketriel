#Introducing Relational

<br>
I prefer using mental crutches to communicate.
One of my favorite  websites on  the internet is  [Indexed](http://thisisindexed.com/) .
Indexed caught my eye because it allows you to explore the weird outcomes when you take a simple premise and explore it more fully.
<br>
Some of my favorite examples:

Relational is a dispatch about what happens when you combine two ideas. In [Telescopic](/posts/Telescopic)
I introduced the idea you can only be using three to four mental mondes at a given time. Relational dives deeply into that idea by combining two elements (mental models, narrative tropes, ideas, traits, events) and exploring the consequences.
