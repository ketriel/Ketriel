# How to Decide What's Worth Committing to Paper or Bytes
<br/>

I've been thinking a lot about what it is to write and write well. So, I'm building a practice around it. These things go better for me if there's a jumping off point, a form of sorts.
So, what are the options?

It's great to use the the word try because, the first human we generally credit with doing this really well is this guy:

### Michel de Montaigne

He asked himself a question: What do I know? Suddenly he was off to the races trying left and right.
Il a essayÃ©.
I ask myself the same question.

## Today's question: What is our standard for writing?


The good news is we have standards or exmeplars. When the costs were high enough that we limited the supply of writing that could be consumed, we got the opinion editorial or "op-ed".
 The practice of publishing op-eds began in 1921 ,by Hebert Bayard Swope, he was quoted:

>It occurred to me that nothing is more interesting than opinion when opinion is interesting, so >I devised a method of cleaning off the page opposite the editorial, which became the most >important in America ... and thereon I decided to print opinions, ignoring facts.

That seems like a bad goal, ignoring facts and only being interesting. So Montaigne starts in 1563, Swope comes along in 1921, and Blogger arrives in 1999. Meanwhile the cost of reaching audience is falling to nearly zero.

## Op-Eds

In modern times, the op-eds guidelines are simple:

[From the NYT](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014809107-How-to-submit-an-Op-Ed-essay "How to submit an Op-Ed Essay")

> The New York Times accepts opinion essays on any topic for both the daily print page and online >section as well as the Sunday Review, the International edition (which is edited out of London  >and Hong Kong), and other themed series. Published pieces typically run from 400 to 1,200 words, > but drafts of any length within bounds of reason will be considered.


Any Topic? That blockquote alone is 63 words, so am I 15% of the way there?

 That structure works for newspapers because it has constraints, the selection of editors, a relatively high cost to spread that information, and a finite amount of pages.
That structure worked for the New York Times but the internet is fundamentally different.
I don't believe we have an implementation of text on the web that is completely native and a strictly superior experience to books.
If the goal is putting out any interesting topic on a platform that's basically free without any barriers, how could we ever expect to even meet the stated goal of being interesting? How will we find the signal if we don't yet know what we're searching for? The web turned 30 and the best tool I know of for finding excellent content is what RSS? Twitter?

So if assumption is the development of our tools will be driven by the business models that can support them, our control surface here, economically, is either reduce supply or increase demand. So, we need a price to make this market find and reach its equilibrium. There's a hardcap on demand, we can't spend all of our time on the Internet. In the current state, one of Twitter or Reddit is our defacto digital newspaper. So, my question becomes would you pay a penny for every tweet/reddit post you read? How much would you pay to change that ratio from 1/45 to 1/5 to 100%?
To only read pinned tweets and posts that were gilded 45x?
