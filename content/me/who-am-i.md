# Hi, I'm Ketriel Mendy.

## Background
My favorite epithet is amateur because it probably means you're trying something new.


Born and Raised in New Orleans.
I've lived in 3 or the four corners of the United States and I think life is always better near the water.
I never spell curiosity correctly the first time I write it.( I think u should be involved in the process)
I would have been a completely different person if someone had told me about Claude Shannon at 16 instead of 23.
##  Interests

### Professional
I am interested in Web3 applications generally


### Personal

I love the processes of revision and editing.

I love ultimate, cinematography, and other things.
